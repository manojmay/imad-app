            I, I wish you could swim
            Like the dolphins
            Like dolphins can swim
            Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
            We can beat them, forever and ever
            Oh, we can be heroes just for one day 
            <i>Heros</i>

            I, I will be King
            And you, you will be Queen
            Though nothing will drive them away
            We can be heroes just for one day
            We can be us just for one day
